Welcome! The below section is part of a subfile, which you can find in the
\colorbox{light-gray}{\texttt{sections/experiment/}} folder. It includes an example of
how to cite and include a figure. Try making edits now!

Once you've made edits, you can build the project by navigating to the \textbf{LaTeX}
tab and selecting $\textcolor{green}{\triangleright} \textbf{Build LaTeX project}$. You
should see the changes reflected in the \colorbox{light-gray}{\texttt{main.pdf}} file.
