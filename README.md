# Welcome! :wave:
This project is a simple $\LaTeX$ project for new users to test out as part of my [*Streamline Scientific Writing with VS Code + Zotero + Github* blog post](https://kevscheuer.github.io/LaTeX-for-VScode/). The instructions for this repo assume you already have a working install of TeX Live and VS Code on your machine. By downloading this sample project you'll have a template for working with git and Zotero in VS Code.

## Instructions :memo:
1. Near the top of the page click the <span style="background-color: #438440; color: white; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;">**<> Code**</span> button
2. Copy the https url (see screenshot below)
